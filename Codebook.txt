Codebook for Getting and Cleaning Data Final Project (Coursera - Data Science specialization)

This codebook describes the data set produced in the final project.  It is on the file 
summerized_tidy_data.txt

There are 4 columns in the file
1. Subject number: an integer that takes on all values from 1 to 30
2. Activity: There are 6 activities
	WALKING: subject was walking
	WALKING_UPSTAIRS: subject was walking upstairs
	WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS: subject was walking downstairs
	SITTING: subject was sitting
	STANDING: subject was standing
	LAYING: subject was laying
3. Variable: there are 66 variables for each subject/activity. They are listed and described below
4. Mean of Variable for each subject/activity
